# ‚ùå TicTacToe ‚≠ï
<i> It's a tic tac toe game you can't beat :V </i>
***
### This program utilizes [minimax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax) algorithm to predict next best possible move assuming the player plays optimally.
Since TicTacToe has very few possible combinations, if two experienced players play TicTacToe, it usually ends up in a draw. So the best you can do against this program is get a draw ;)

## How To play:
1.  git clone https://github.com/soham0-0/TicTacToe.git
2.  cd TicTacToe/
3.  g++ main.cpp
4.  **For Windows:**  a.exe</br>
    **For Linux:**    ./a.out
5. Follow the instructions

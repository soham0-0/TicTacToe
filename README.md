# ‚ùå TicTacToe ‚≠ï
_It's a tic tac toe game you can't beat :V_
***
### This program utilizes [minimax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax) algorithm to predict next best possible move assuming the player plays optimally.
Since TicTacToe has very few possible combinations, if two experienced players play TicTacToe, it usually ends up in a draw. So the best you can do against this program is get a draw ;)
